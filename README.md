# JLPT-Notify
A small Go program that checks the [JLPT Leiden](https://jlpt-leiden.nl) website periodically and notifies me by SMS whenever the source code changes.

## Why?
I missed out on registrations for the JLPT exam this year because I couldn't register in time. I want
to avoid a similar situation next year by getting a notification the moment registrations open up.
